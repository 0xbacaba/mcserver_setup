#  Utils

Place utility scripts here which can be linked to servers.
The differences to the default directory are:
- The files will be linked instead of copied
- Only shell files (*.sh) will be included
- Variables inside the files (like server name and version) will not be replaced

The script will automatically ask which files to link when creating a new server.
